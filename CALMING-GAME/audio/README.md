# Audio for Calming Game

## Background piano

Place a calming piano track here so the experience can play it in a loop:

- **Filename:** `calm-piano.mp3`
- **Location:** `CALMING-GAME/audio/calm-piano.mp3`

Use a royalty-free track (e.g. from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/search/piano%20calm/) or [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org)) so the project stays safe for personal and portfolio use.

The chime when you tap an orb is generated in the browser (no file needed).
